 Challenge Lab: Amazon S3 
I completed a hands-on challenge working with the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon S3. Here's how I tackled it.
- Task 1: Connecting to the CLI Host Instance
I started by connecting to my EC2 instance via SSH. This gave me direct access to the command line where I could start working with AWS services.
- Task 2: Configuring the AWS CLI
Once connected, I used the SSH client to set up and configure the AWS CLI on my EC2 instance. This step was crucial because it allowed me to interact with AWS services directly from the command line.
- Task 3: Finishing the Challenge
This is where I put everything together and completed the actual challenge.
- Creating the Bucket
I used the AWS CLI to create a new S3 bucket. This was my first time creating cloud storage from the command line instead of clicking through the console.
- Uploading an Object
- Next, I uploaded a file (an object) into my newly created S3 bucket using CLI commands.
- Listing the Bucket Contents
I ran a command to list all the contents of my S3 bucket, verifying that my uploaded file was actually there. Seeing the output in the terminal confirmed everything worked correctly.
- Accessing the Object via Web Browser
Finally, I accessed my uploaded object using a web browser to prove that it was publicly accessible and properly stored in S3.

  # CHALLENGES
  Permission Errors: Even with credentials set up, I got "Access Denied" errors because my IAM permissions were not set properly.worked a way around it and found out how to correct the error.
# WHAT I LEARNED
Here’s what I learned from this lab:
- I set up an S3 bucket, which works like creating a dedicated folder in the cloud for storing data.
- I uploaded an object into the bucket so I could store and manage data directly in S3.
- I learned how to open the object in a web browser, showing how S3 can be used to make files publicly accessible when needed
- I used the AWS CLI to list everything inside the S3 bucket, which is helpful for managing and checking files through the command line
# OVERALL
I learned how to create cloud storage, upload data, access it from the web, and manage it using the CLI — all essential skills for working with Amazon S3
