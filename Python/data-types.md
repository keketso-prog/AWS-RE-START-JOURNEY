## Working with Numeric Data Types

- I clicked "Start Lab" and waited for the "Lab status: ready" message. Then I accessed the AWS Management Console, selected Cloud9, found the reStart-python-cloud9 environment, and opened the IDE.
Setting Up My Workspace
- I created a new Python file by choosing File > New From Template > Python File, deleted the sample code, and saved the file. Then I opened a new terminal session by clicking the + icon and selecting "New Terminal." I used the pwd command to confirm my working directory was /home/ec2-user/environment.
- Exercise 1: Using the Python Shell
I entered the Python shell and tested basic arithmetic operations:

- Entered 2+2 and got 4
- Entered 4-2 and got 2
- Entered 2*2 and got 4
- Entered 4/2 and got 2.0

Then I exited the Python shell.
- Exercise 2: Introducing the int Data Type
I ran multiple code examples to understand integer data types and their operations, observing how whole numbers behave in Python.
- Exercise 3: Introducing the float Data Type
I explored floating-point numbers by running various code examples, learning how Python handles decimal values and their arithmetic operations.
- Exercise 4: Introducing the complex Data Type
I worked with complex numbers, running code to see how Python represents and operates on numbers with real and imaginary components.
- Exercise 5: Introducing the bool Data Type
I experimented with Boolean values (True and False), running code to understand how logical operations work in Python

# CHALLENGES
I initially got confused when division operations returned different data types—specifically when 4/2 returned 2.0 (a float) instead of 2 (an int). It took me a moment to understand that Python's division operator always returns a float, even when dividing evenly.
# WHAT I LEARNED
Here's what I learned from this:

- I explored Python's numeric data types including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), complex numbers (complex), and boolean values (bool).
- I used the Python shell to interactively test and understand how different data types store and handle numeric values.
- I discovered why Python is popular among data scientists, as it provides powerful built-in tools for mathematical operations and data analysis.
# OVERALL
I learned how Python handles different types of numeric data and gained hands-on experience using the Python shell to perform calculations. This foundational knowledge is essential for working with data analysis and understanding how Python stores and processes numerical information.
