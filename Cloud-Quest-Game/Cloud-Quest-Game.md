🎮 AWS Cloud Quest - Cloud Practitioner Journey

What I Did in Cloud Quest:

1. Cloud Computing Essentials ☁️💡
I came to understand the basics of Cloud Computing and what AWS is all about. I found out how the cloud works, why companies use it instead of buying their own servers, and the main benefits, such as cost savings and flexibility. I used the AWS Management Console and familiarized myself with how to get around and see all the different services available. This was my introduction to understanding that the cloud is just someone else's computers that we can rent and use over the internet.

3. Cloud First Steps 👣🚀
    took my first real steps in AWS by creating and launching my first EC2 instance, better known as a virtual server. I learned how to choose the right size server, pick an operating system, and configure the basic settings. I connected to my server using SSH and ran some commands to make sure everything was working. This taught me that starting a server in the cloud only takes minutes, not weeks like traditional data centers. I also learned to stop and start instances in order to save money.

4. Computing Solutions 💻⚙️
   I'm solving specific problems with different types of EC2 instances. I learned about general-purpose, compute-optimized, and memory-optimized instance types. I did practice choosing the right instance for the job - such as using a powerful CPU instance for calculations or a high-memory instance for database applications. I also learned about pricing options like On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot instances to get the best prices, considering my needs.

5. Networking Concepts 🌐🔌
   I learned how networking works in AWS and created my first VPC. I discovered what IP addresses are, the difference between public and private IPs, how subnets divide the networks into sections, learned about CIDR notation-as in /24-and how to calculate how many devices can fit in a subnet. I also learned the basics of routing and how data travels from one place to another via routers and gateways.

6. Connecting VPCs 🔗🌉
   I connected multiple VPCs together so they could communicate with each other. I learned about VPC peering, which allows the configuration of a private connection between two VPCs without using the internet. I configured route tables to forward traffic between VPCs and ensured security groups allowed the right connections. This will teach me how large companies connect different departments or regions while keeping everything secure and private within AWS's network.

7. Cloud Economics 💰📊
   I learned how to calculate and optimize cloud costs. I explored the AWS pricing calculator to estimate the monthly bills before building anything. I found cost optimization strategies, such as using Reserved Instances for steady workloads, using Spot Instances for flexible jobs, and right-sizing instances to avoid paying for unused resources. I also came across the AWS Free Tier and how to set up billing alarms so as not to get surprise charges. It showed me that managing costs is just as important as building solutions.

8. Databases in Practice 🗄️💾
   I built my first relational database on Amazon RDS. I learned the difference between having my own database on EC2 and using RDS, where AWS handles backups, updates, and maintenance automatically for me. So I configured database settings like storage size, backup retention, and multi-AZ deployment for high availability. I then connected an application to the database and practiced storing and retrieving data. This taught me that managed databases save a ton of time and effort.

9. First NoSQL Database 📦🚀
   I created my first NoSQL database using Amazon DynamoDB. I learned that NoSQL databases differ from the traditional SQL ones; they are faster, more flexible, and better for specific use cases, such as mobile apps or gaming. I created tables, put items within them with different attributes, and queried data. I found out about such concepts as partition keys, sort keys, and how DynamoDB scales itself automatically to sustain millions of requests. It showed me that not all data needs to be in the traditional table format.

10. File Systems in the Cloud 📁☁️
    I worked with different storage services in AWS. I used Amazon S3, Simple Storage Service, for storing files like images, videos, and backups, learning that S3 is object storage that is super durable and cheap. I also explored Amazon EFS, Elastic File System, which works like a shared network drive that multiple EC2 instances can access at the same time. I learned when to use each storage type: S3 for static files and backups, EBS for server hard drives, and EFS for shared files across servers.

11. Core Security Concepts 🔒🛡️
    I learned the fundamental security practices in AWS. I worked with IAM-Identity and Access Management-to create users, groups, and roles with specific permissions, giving access to only those resources that are needed. I have configured the security groups-virtual firewalls-to control who can access my servers and on which ports. I learned about encryption for data at rest and in transit, and why we should never share access keys or passwords. This taught me that security must be built in from the start, not added later.

12. Auto Healing and Scaling Applications 🔄📈
    I created automatic healing and scaling of my application. I learned the use of Auto Scaling Groups that add servers automatically when traffic increases and remove them when traffic decreases so I will pay only for what I use. I configured health checks that detect server failures automatically and replace them with new ones without human intervention. Besides, I set up alarms in CloudWatch to monitor performance and scale accordingly. That showed me how the cloud could make applications self-managing and resilient.

13. Highly Available Web Applications 🌐💪
    I built a complete, highly available web application that can survive server failures. I used servers deployed across multiple Availability Zones such that if one data center goes down due to problems, my app will remain running in another. I also configured an Elastic Load Balancer to equally distribute traffic between multiple servers and automatically route around failed ones. I then combined this with Auto Scaling Groups, RDS Multi-AZ databases, and S3 for static files to create a fully redundant system. This final quest has taught me how to architect professional, enterprise-grade applications that stay online 24/7 even when things go wrong

🎓 What I Learned Overall:

☁️✨I knew nothing about cloud computing until, through these 12 quests in the class, I learned to build secure, scalable, cost-optimized, and highly available applications on AWS. Cloud isn't about technology; it's about creating smarter, faster, and more reliable solutions than traditional IT. I will know what each of the core AWS services is all about, learn best practices about security and cost management, and learn how to architect applications that can handle the demands of the real world. Having taken this course gave me hands-on, practical experience that can be used on real cloud projects!
