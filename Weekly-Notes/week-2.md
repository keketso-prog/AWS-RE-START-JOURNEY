Linux Basics

What is Linux?

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows or macOS, but it's free and open-source.
Think of it like this: If Windows is like buying a pre-built house, Linux is like getting the blueprint to build your own house exactly how you want it.
Why it matters for AWS:

Most cloud servers run Linux
It's lightweight and fast
Free to use (no licensing costs)
Very stable and secure

Common Linux distributions:

Ubuntu (most beginner-friendly)
Amazon Linux (AWS's own version, optimized for EC2)
Red Hat / CentOS
Debian
