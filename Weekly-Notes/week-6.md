Retrieving Data from Your Database (SELECT) This is the method you use to request information from the database.

To obtain specific columns: Specify precisely what you wish to view. SELECT name FROM customers; Translation: "Display only the name column from the customers table." To retrieve multiple columns: Simply enumerate them. SELECT name, email FROM customers; Translation: "Provide the name and email for all customers." To access everything: Utilize the * wildcard. SELECT * FROM customers; Translation: "Display all columns for all customers." To refine your results: Employ WHERE to set conditions. SELECT name FROM customers WHERE age > 18; Translation: "Display the names of customers who are older than 18." 2. Inserting New Information (INSERT) This is the procedure for adding a new row of data to a table.

To insert a single new row: INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John', 'john@email.com'); Translation: "Insert a new customer named 'John' with the email 'john@email.com'." To insert multiple rows simultaneously (more efficient): INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('Sarah', 'sarah@email.com'), ('Mike', 'mike@email.com'); Translation: "Insert two new customers, Sarah and Mike, in one operation." 3. Performing Calculations & Modifying Text (Functions) Functions are integrated tools that execute actions on your data.

Mathematical Functions (operate on numerous rows at once): COUNT() - Counts the total number of rows. SUM() - Totals all the numbers in a column. AVG() - Computes the average. MAX() - Identifies the highest value. MIN() - Determines the lowest value. Text Functions (alter the appearance of text): UPPER() - Transforms text to ALL CAPS. LOWER() - Converts text to all lowercase. CONCAT() - Combines text together. 4. Organizing and Grouping Your Results This is the method for structuring the data you receive to enhance its utility.

Sorting (ORDER BY): Arrange your results in a designated order. SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price ASC; Translation: "Display all products, sorted by price from lowest to highest." (Use DESC for highest to lowest). Grouping (GROUP BY): Organizes similar data into categories. SELECT category
