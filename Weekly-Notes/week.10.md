# Week 10

# Tagging

- Basically labeling your resources so you can organize and find them easily
- Like putting sticky notes on things to identify them
- Can tag by project name, department, environment (production, testing, etc.)
- Super helpful for tracking costs and finding specific resources
- Key is being consistent—inconsistent tagging becomes messy fast

# AWS CloudFormation

- Lets you build AWS infrastructure using code instead of clicking around
- Write a template describing what you want (servers, databases, networks)
- CloudFormation creates everything automatically based on your template
- Can reuse templates and recreate the same setup anytime
- Like having a blueprint for your infrastructure

# CloudTrail

- AWS's security camera that records everything in your account
- Logs who did what, when, and where
- Tracks deletions, changes, and all activities
- Crucial for security audits and troubleshooting
- Can go back and investigate what happened if something breaks

# Using ML and AI

- Machine learning trains models to learn patterns instead of writing specific rules
- AWS has services that make this easier without needing to be a data scientist
- Can use pre-built models for image recognition, text analysis, predictions
- Main challenge is having good quality data to train with
- Becoming everyday tools for solving real problems

# JSON and YAML

- Both are ways to structure data in readable formats
- JSON uses brackets, more strict about syntax
- YAML is cleaner, easier to read, uses indentation like Python
- Both organize information for humans and computers
- CloudFormation templates work with either, but YAML is usually preferred

# Infrastructure as Code

- Managing infrastructure like you manage software code
- Write code that sets up servers and networks automatically
- No more manual setup, everything is repeatable
- Can version control, test, and roll back if needed
- Reduces human error significantly
- CloudFormation and Terraform are popular tools for this
- Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
