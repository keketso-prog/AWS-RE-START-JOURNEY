Under python, we did a number of labs.i will show case 3 of the labs here

## THIRD LAB LAB



## Write a Python script to:

Display all the prime numbers between 1 to 250.
Store the results in a results.txt file.
Test the script. Verify that it produced the expected results in the results.txt file.

Save the script and make a note of its location (absolute path) for future reference.

Note: Both Python 2 and Python 3 are installed on the Linux Host. It is recommended to use Python 3. To run a Python script using version 3, run the following command by replacing file.py with your file name.

python3 file.py

- Created the Python script file using the nano text editor by executing nano prime_numbers.py in the Linux terminal.

- Wrote the prime-checking function that tests whether a number is prime by checking for divisibility from 2 up to the number itself.
- Implemented the main logic using a loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 250, applying the prime-checking function to each number and storing results in a list.
- Added output functionality to display the prime numbers in the console using the print() function.
- Configured file writing to save results to results.txt using Python's file handling methods (open(), write(), and close()).
- Saved the script in nano by pressing Ctrl+X, confirming with Y, and pressing Enter.

- Executed the script using the command python3 prime_numbers.py.

- Verified the results by viewing the contents of results.txt using the cat command, which confirmed that all 53 prime numbers were successfully identified and stored.

- Documented the script location by obtaining the absolute path using the realpath prime_numbers.py command for future reference.

# The script successfully identified 53 prime numbers and saved them to the results file as required.
