## PYTHON
Under python, we did a number of labs.i will show case 3 of the labs here

## FIRST LAB
# HELLO WORLD

I worked through an introductory lab with Python programming using AWS Cloud9, learning how to set up my development environment and write my first Python program. Here's what I did.
- Starting the Lab Environment
I clicked "Start Lab" at the top of the instructions and waited for the "Lab status: ready" message before closing the panel. Then I accessed the AWS Management Console, selected Services > Cloud9, found the reStart-python-cloud9 environment, and clicked "Open IDE."
- Exercise 1: Creating a Python Exercise File
In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, I created a new Python file by choosing File > New From Template > Python File. I deleted the sample code from the template and saved the file using File > Save As.
- Accessing the Terminal Session
I opened a terminal by clicking the + icon and selecting "New Terminal." I used the pwd command to check my present working directory, which showed /home/ec2-user/environment. Then I checked the default Python version and explored other available Python versions installed in the environment.
- Exercise 2: Writing My First Python Program
I entered Python code into my file and ran it to see the results, successfully executing my first Python program in the Cloud9 environment.

# CHALLENGES
At first, I wasn't sure how to run my Python file from the terminal. I had to figure out the correct command to execute the script, and initially forgot to save my file before running it, which caused confusion when my code changes didn't appear in the output


# WHAT I LEARNED
Here's what I learned from this:

- I created my first Python program following the traditional "Hello, World" exercise, which is the standard starting point for learning any programming language.
- I verified that Python was correctly installed and configured on my Linux system by successfully running a basic script.
- I used the nano text editor to write Python code and executed it from the command line using the python3 command.
# OVERALL
I learned how to set up and run a basic Python program on a Linux environment, confirming that my development tools are properly installed and functional. This foundational exercise prepared me for writing more complex Python scripts.

## SECOND LAB
## Working with Numeric Data Types

- I clicked "Start Lab" and waited for the "Lab status: ready" message. Then I accessed the AWS Management Console, selected Cloud9, found the reStart-python-cloud9 environment, and opened the IDE.
Setting Up My Workspace
- I created a new Python file by choosing File > New From Template > Python File, deleted the sample code, and saved the file. Then I opened a new terminal session by clicking the + icon and selecting "New Terminal." I used the pwd command to confirm my working directory was /home/ec2-user/environment.
- Exercise 1: Using the Python Shell
I entered the Python shell and tested basic arithmetic operations:

- Entered 2+2 and got 4
- Entered 4-2 and got 2
- Entered 2*2 and got 4
- Entered 4/2 and got 2.0

Then I exited the Python shell.
- Exercise 2: Introducing the int Data Type
I ran multiple code examples to understand integer data types and their operations, observing how whole numbers behave in Python.
- Exercise 3: Introducing the float Data Type
I explored floating-point numbers by running various code examples, learning how Python handles decimal values and their arithmetic operations.
- Exercise 4: Introducing the complex Data Type
I worked with complex numbers, running code to see how Python represents and operates on numbers with real and imaginary components.
- Exercise 5: Introducing the bool Data Type
I experimented with Boolean values (True and False), running code to understand how logical operations work in Python

# CHALLENGES
I initially got confused when division operations returned different data types—specifically when 4/2 returned 2.0 (a float) instead of 2 (an int). It took me a moment to understand that Python's division operator always returns a float, even when dividing evenly.
# WHAT I LEARNED
Here's what I learned from this:

- I explored Python's numeric data types including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), complex numbers (complex), and boolean values (bool).
- I used the Python shell to interactively test and understand how different data types store and handle numeric values.
- I discovered why Python is popular among data scientists, as it provides powerful built-in tools for mathematical operations and data analysis.
# OVERALL
I learned how Python handles different types of numeric data and gained hands-on experience using the Python shell to perform calculations. This foundational knowledge is essential for working with data analysis and understanding how Python stores and processes numerical information.

## THIRD LAB LAB
I worked through a Python programming lab where I created a script to identify prime numbers between 1 and 250, learning about functions, loops, and file handling. Here's what I did.
# Creating the Python Script
I created a Python script file using the nano text editor by executing nano prime_numbers.py in the Linux terminal.
# Writing the Prime Number Logic
I wrote a prime-checking function that tests whether a number is prime by checking for divisibility from 2 up to the number itself. Then I implemented the main logic using a loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 250, applying the prime-checking function to each number and storing the results in a list.
# Adding Output and File Writing
I added output functionality to display the prime numbers in the console using the print() function. Then I configured file writing to save results to results.txt using Python's file handling methods (open(), write(), and close()).
# Saving and Running the Script
I saved the script in nano by pressing Ctrl+X, confirming with Y, and pressing Enter. Then I executed the script using the command python3 prime_numbers.py.
# Verifying the Results
I verified the results by viewing the contents of results.txt using the cat command, which confirmed that all 53 prime numbers were successfully identified and stored. I documented the script location by obtaining the absolute path using realpath prime_numbers.py for future reference.

 The script successfully identified 53 prime numbers and saved them to the results file as required.
 # CHALLENGES
 File Handling Syntax: I struggled with properly closing the file after writing to it. I forgot to include the close() method initially, which could have caused issues with data not being saved properly to results.txt.
## WHAT I LEARNED
Here's what I learned from this challenge:

- I created a Python script using the nano text editor and learned the importance of proper indentation and syntax in Python.
- I implemented a prime number algorithm that identifies all prime numbers between 1 and 250 by checking for divisibility.
- I used Python's file handling methods to write results to a text file for permanent storage.
# OVERALL
I learned how to write and execute Python scripts on Linux, process numerical data, and save output to external files using the command line
