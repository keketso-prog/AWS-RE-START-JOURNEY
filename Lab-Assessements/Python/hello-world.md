# HELLO WORLD

I worked through an introductory lab with Python programming using AWS Cloud9, learning how to set up my development environment and write my first Python program. Here's what I did.
- Starting the Lab Environment
I clicked "Start Lab" at the top of the instructions and waited for the "Lab status: ready" message before closing the panel. Then I accessed the AWS Management Console, selected Services > Cloud9, found the reStart-python-cloud9 environment, and clicked "Open IDE."

- Exercise 1: Creating a Python Exercise File
In the AWS Cloud9 IDE, I created a new Python file by choosing File > New From Template > Python File. I deleted the sample code from the template and saved the file using File > Save As.
- Accessing the Terminal Session
I opened a terminal by clicking the + icon and selecting "New Terminal." I used the pwd command to check my present working directory, which showed /home/ec2-user/environment. Then I checked the default Python version and explored other available Python versions installed in the environment.
- Exercise 2: Writing My First Python Program
I entered Python code into my file and ran it to see the results, successfully executing my first Python program in the Cloud9 environment.

# CHALLENGES
At first, I wasn't sure how to run my Python file from the terminal. I had to figure out the correct command to execute the script, and initially forgot to save my file before running it, which caused confusion when my code changes didn't appear in the output


# WHAT I LEARNED
Here's what I learned from this:

- I created my first Python program following the traditional "Hello, World" exercise, which is the standard starting point for learning any programming language.
- I verified that Python was correctly installed and configured on my Linux system by successfully running a basic script.
- I used the nano text editor to write Python code and executed it from the command line using the python3 command.
# OVERALL
I learned how to set up and run a basic Python program on a Linux environment, confirming that my development tools are properly installed and functional. This foundational exercise prepared me for writing more complex Python scripts.
