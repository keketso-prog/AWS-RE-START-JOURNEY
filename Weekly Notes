What is AWS?
🌩️ What is AWS?

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
It is a cloud computing platform made by Amazon.

That means instead of buying and managing your own computers (servers),
you can rent computing power, storage, and tools from Amazon over the internet.

🕰️ Here is a Short History of AWS

2002: Amazon started experimenting with web services.

2006: AWS officially launched with a few basic services:

S3 (for file storage)

EC2 (for virtual computers/servers)

SQS (for message queuing)

2010s: AWS grew fast — many startups and big companies started using it.

Today: AWS is one of the largest cloud providers in the world, along with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.
