About Me üëãüìù‚ú®

I am an eager and driven learner participating in the AWS re/Start 12-week program, a comprehensive, instructor-led course aimed at equipping individuals for careers in cloud computing and IT.

During the program, I am acquiring practical experience in essential areas like:

Basics of Linux and scripting

Networking and security principles

Data storage systems and cloud infrastructure

Amazon Web Services (AWS) fundamental services such as EC2, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch

The program features hands-on labs, knowledge evaluations, and assessments, enabling me to utilize theoretical insights in practical cloud settings and enhance my technical troubleshooting abilities.

Along with the technical knowledge, I am honing professional skills like teamwork, communication, and career preparedness, equipping me to make meaningful contributions in a cloud or IT support position following graduation.

I have a strong enthusiasm for cloud technology. I am eager to apply my training to start a career as a Cloud Support Associate, DevOps Engineer, or IT Infrastructure Specialist.
