About Me üëãüìù‚ú®

I am a committed and enthusiastic learner enrolled in the AWS re/Start 12-week program, which is an in-depth, instructor-led course that prepares its students for cloud computing and IT careers.

Throughout the program, I will have practical experience in the following areas:

Basics of Linux and scripting

Networking and security principles

Data storage systems and cloud infrastructure

fundamental services of AWS such as EC2, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch

The program will include hands-on labs, knowledge checks, and assessments that allow me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical cloud environments and develop my technical troubleshooting skills.

Complementing this technical knowledge, I will be bringing professional skills of teamwork, communication, and career preparedness that would enable me to contribute meaningfully to any organization offering cloud-related services or IT support upon graduation.

I am enthusiastic about cloud technology. I look forward with excitement to applying my training in the commencement of a career as a Cloud Support Associate, DevOps Engineer, or IT Infrastructure Specialist.
