About Me

At present, I am participating in the AWS re/Start program, a comprehensive 12-week, full-time training course designed to build foundational cloud computing abilities and prepare candidates for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner credential. Throughout the program, I am gaining hands-on experience through lab assessments, knowledge checks, and mock exams, which help me strengthen both my technical understanding and practical application of AWS services.

This course encompasses an extensive array of subjects, such as cloud basics, networking, security, databases, and essential AWS services like EC2, S3, and IAM. In addition to technical skills, I am also developing essential employability skills such as communication, problem-solving, and teamwork to prepare for a career in cloud and IT.

I have a strong enthusiasm for cloud technology and am excited to embark on a career where I can utilize my AWS expertise to tackle real-world problems, contribute to pioneering projects, and keep advancing in the constantly changing tech environment.
