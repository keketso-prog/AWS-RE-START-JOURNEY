AWS Cloud Quest - Cloud Practitioner
Completed hands-on training through AWS Cloud Quest, an interactive learning program that teaches cloud fundamentals through practical challenges.

## Overview

Cloud Quest is an interactive, role-playing game that teaches AWS cloud concepts through practical challenges. Each quest involves solving real business problems using AWS services, which helped me understand not just how services work, but when and why to use them.

## What I Learned

# Compute & Networking

- EC2 instances and instance types
- VPC creation and VPC peering
- IP addressing and subnets

# Databases & Storage

- Amazon RDS (relational databases)
- DynamoDB (NoSQL databases)
- S3, EBS, and EFS storage services

# Operations

- IAM and security groups
- Auto Scaling and CloudWatch monitoring
- High availability architectures with load balancing
- Cost optimization strategies

## Key Skills Gained

- Launching and managing EC2 instances
- Designing and implementing VPC networks
- Working with both SQL (RDS) and NoSQL (DynamoDB) databases
- Understanding AWS storage options and use cases
- Implementing security best practices with IAM and security groups
- Building applications that automatically scale and heal
- Creating highly available architectures that survive failures
- Managing and optimizing cloud costs

## Screenshots

Each quest includes screenshots documenting my progress and the solutions I built. These provide visual reference for the configurations and architectures implemented during the training.

## Next Steps

This Cloud Practitioner foundation prepares me for more advanced AWS learning paths and certifications. The practical experience gained here applies directly to real-world cloud projects and solutions architecture.
