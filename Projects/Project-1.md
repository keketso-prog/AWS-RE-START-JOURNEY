# Project 1 - Building a Static Website for a Restaurant and Presenting AWS Migration Benefits

#  Project Overview
You are tasked with creating a static website for a real-world restaurant (you can choose an
existing local restaurant or a small business). The restaurant is experiencing operational
challenges due to a high volume of customer bookings and orders, which are getting mixed up,
and the owner is struggling to find a solution. The owner wants to use a simple static website to
streamline customer interactions and improve order and booking management. Additionally, you
will prepare a presentation to showcase the benefits of migrating the restaurant’s digital
presence to AWS, targeting a panel of your choice (e.g., the restaurant owner or a mock
business panel).

# Static Website: Build a fully functional static website for the restaurant, hosted on AWS.

# Company Overview
The restaurant (e.g., “Marble Bistro,” a local eatery) is a popular dining spot
experiencing a surge in customers. They receive a high volume of bookings and
orders daily, both in-person and via phone or email. However, their current
manual system (e.g., paper-based or basic spreadsheet tracking) leads to
frequent mix-ups—orders get confused, bookings are double-booked, and the
owner struggles to track customer preferences or confirmations. The owner wants
to implement a simple static website to allow customers to make bookings and
place orders online, reducing errors and improving efficiency.
# Restaurant Challenges
• The restaurant has not migrated to the cloud and relies on manual or on
premises systems (e.g., paper records or a local computer) to manage
bookings and orders.
• This leads to operational inefficiencies: order mix-ups (e.g., wrong dishes
delivered), double bookings, and delays in confirming customer requests.
• The owner lacks a centralised system to track customer data, making it hard to
identify repeat customers or manage special requests.
• Scaling the current system to handle more customers is costly and time
consuming (e.g., hiring more staff to manage orders or upgrading on-premises
hardware).
# AWS Services: Recommend AWS services to address the restaurant’s needs:
• Use Amazon S3 to host the static website and store images (e.g., menu
photos).
