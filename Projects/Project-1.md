# Marble Bistro - Static Website Project
👇 Below i will be explaining about the project in detail. ❗❗❗Please see the Project Gallery for the visuals and more explaination of how we hosted the static website.
# About This Project
Our team of five took on the challenge of helping Marble Bistro, a busy local restaurant that was drowning in paperwork and missed reservations. What started as a straightforward web development assignment turned into a real eye-opener about how small businesses struggle without the right digital tools.
# The Problem We Found
Walking into Marble Bistro for the first time, we immediately saw the chaos.
- The owner was juggling phone calls, scribbling bookings on a worn-out notepad, and trying to keep track of takeout orders on scattered sticky notes.
- It was honestly stressful just watching
# The issues were piling up:

- Orders were getting mixed up almost daily—imagine ordering pasta and getting someone else's burger
- Double bookings happened so often that the owner had started turning away customers just to be safe
- Customers would call to confirm their reservations and wait hours for a callback because the owner was too swamped
- There was no way to remember regular customers or their preferences, which meant missing out on that personal touch that makes small restaurants special
- The thought of expanding or handling more customers? Forget it. They'd need to hire more people just to manage the phones and paperwork

The owner was frustrated and exhausted. They needed help, and honestly, we were excited to provide it.
# What We Built
We created a clean, straightforward website where customers can actually book tables and place orders without picking up the phone. Nothing fancy or overcomplicated—just a solid solution that works.
# The site includes:

- An easy-to-navigate menu that looks great on phones and computers
- A booking system that shows real-time availability (no more double bookings!)
- Online ordering so customers can browse and order at their own pace
- A way to keep track of customer preferences and special requests

We decided to host everything on AWS because, frankly, it made the most sense for what the restaurant needed.
# Why We Went With AWS
When we sat down with the owner to explain our recommendation, we wanted to keep things simple and practical. 
# Here's what sold them on AWS:
- It's Actually Affordable: The owner was worried about costs, but AWS pricing blew their mind.
- They're only charged for what they actually use—no expensive servers gathering dust in a back room.
- For a static website like this, the monthly cost is less than what they'd spend on printer paper and ink for their old system.
- It Just Works: We promised 99.99% uptime, and the owner asked what that meant in real terms.
-We explained: "Your website will be up and running pretty much always—even at 2 AM when someone's craving your food and wants to place an order for tomorrow." That clicked immediately.
- Handles the Rush: Remember Valentine's Day or Mother's Day when the restaurant gets absolutely slammed? The website can handle those traffic spikes without breaking a sweat. No crashes, no slowdowns, no turning customers away.
- Way More Secure: We didn't get too technical here, but we explained that AWS protects customer information way better than a filing cabinet or an old computer ever could. In today's world, that peace of mind matters to customers.
- Zero Maintenance Headaches: This was huge. The owner doesn't know much about technology and didn't want to learn. With AWS managing the infrastructure, they don't need to. No updates to install, no servers to maintain, nothing. It just runs.
- Fast Loading Times: Nobody likes waiting for a slow website to load. With AWS CloudFront, the site loads quickly whether customers are at home or commuting. Happy customers, more orders.
- Room to Grow: Down the line, if the restaurant wants to add features—maybe email confirmations, loyalty programs, or a mobile app—AWS makes it straightforward to expand without starting from scratch.
# How We Built It
We kept the technical side simple but effective:

- Amazon S3 for hosting the website files
- CloudFront to make sure pages load fast everywhere
- Route 53 for managing the domain name
- Certificate Manager to keep everything secure with HTTPS

# Working as a Team
Honestly, five people working on one project could've been messy, but we made it work. We split up the tasks based on what everyone was good at—some of us handled the design and coding, others tackled the AWS setup, and a few focused on creating the content and preparing our presentation. We had our moments of disagreement (especially about color schemes!), but overall, we're pretty proud of what we pulled together.

# What Changed
A few weeks after launch, we stopped by to check in with the owner. The difference was honestly amazing. They greeted us with a huge smile—completely different from the stressed-out person we'd first met.
The double bookings were gone, orders were coming through clearly, and the owner wasn't glued to their phone anymore. They actually had time to walk around the dining room, chat with customers, and focus on what they love—the food and the experience.
Even the staff seemed relieved. When orders are clear and bookings are organized, everyone's job gets easier.
