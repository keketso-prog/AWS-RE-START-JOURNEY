## About This Project
You are part of a startup team launching a next-generation 3D e-commerce web application. 
This platform will allow users to interact with 3D models of products (e.g., furniture, gadgets, 
fashion items) before purchasing. Millions of users are expected globally, and the experience 
must be fast, highly available, secure, and cost-efficient.
As a Cloud Practitioner, your role is to design the cloud architecture using AWS services to 
support this 3D application and meet key business and technical requirements

## 1. Design the Architecture
We used AWS services such as:
▪ Amazon S3 for 3D asset storage
▪ CloudFront for content delivery
▪ EC2 / AWS Lambda for backend compute
▪ RDS / DynamoDB for product and customer data
▪ Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for traffic distribution
▪ Route 53 for domain management
▪ CloudWatch & Trusted Advisor for monitoring and optimization


##  2. Explain Your Choices
-  Write a brief document (1–2 pages) explaining:
- Why you chose each AWS service.
- How your architecture meets each of the 5 requirements.
- Any design trade-offs or challenges
