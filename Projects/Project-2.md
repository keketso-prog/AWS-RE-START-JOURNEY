This platform will allow users to interact with 3D models of products (e.g., furniture, gadgets, 
fashion items) before purchasing. Millions of users are expected globally, and the experience 
must be fast, highly available, secure, and cost-efficient.
As a Cloud Practitioner, your role is to design the cloud architecture using AWS services to 
support this 3D application and meet key business and technical requirements
