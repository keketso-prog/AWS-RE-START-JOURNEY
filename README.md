# AWS re/Start Journey ☁️

Welcome! This repository documents my 12-week journey through the **AWS re/Start program**

# OVERVIEW

This repository serves as a complete record of my experience in the AWS re/Start program, an intensive technical training curriculum designed to prepare participants for entry-level cloud computing careers. Throughout this program, I developed proficiency in:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) – Cloud infrastructure and services
- Linux Administration – System operations and command-line proficiency
- Networking Fundamentals – TCP/IP, routing, and network architecture
- Security Best Practices – Cloud security principles and implementation
- Python Programming – Automation and scripting for cloud environments

This portfolio documents my technical progression, hands-on project work, and practical application of cloud computing concepts.
