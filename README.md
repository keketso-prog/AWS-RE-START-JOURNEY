 AWS RE/START JOURNEY 📕 📖

 
 Welcome! This repository documents my 12-week journey through the AWS re/Start program, an intensive instructor-led training designed to build basic skills in cloud computing, Linux, networks, security, and AWS services. Throughout this programme, I completed a variety of labs, projects, knowledge-checks and assessments to develop both technical competences and professional preparations for cloud and IT careers. This repository contains: 
 
-  About Me - An overview of my background, goals and interests in cloud computing. ⋆˚࿔ 𝐌𝑬 𝜗𝜚˚⋆
 
-  Weekly notes – key learning, insights and reflections from each week of the program. 📜
 
-  Learning Roadmap - A structured overview of my progress and milestones over the past 12 weeks. 🏁
 
-  Project Gallery – Hands-on projects that show the practical application of the AWS concept. 🚀
 
-  Labs Assessments – Practice and Assessment exercises that demonstrate technical knowledge and problem solving skills. 🥼
  
-  AWS Cloud Quest is an interactive role-playing game where I complete hands-on cloud computing challenges by solving real-world scenarios and building actual AWS solutions to level up my cloud skills.
  
- AWS Projects are practical, guided exercises where I build real applications and infrastructure on AWS to apply what I've learned and gain hands-on experience with cloud services.
