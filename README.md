 AWS RE/START JOURNEY 

 
 Welcome! This repository documents my 12-week journey through the AWS re/Start program, an intensive instructor-led training designed to build basic skills in cloud computing, Linux, networks, security, and AWS services. Throughout this programme, I completed a variety of labs, projects, knowledge-checks and assessments to develop both technical competences and professional preparations for cloud and IT careers. This repository contains: About Me - An overview of my background, goals and interests in cloud computing. Weekly notes – key learning, insights and reflections from each week of the program. Learning Roadmap - A structured overview of my progress and milestones over the past 12 weeks. Project Gallery – Hands-on projects that show the practical application of the AWS concept. Labs & Assessments – Practice and Assessment exercises that demonstrate technical knowledge and problem solving skills.
