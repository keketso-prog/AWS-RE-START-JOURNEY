What is AWS?
üå©Ô∏è What is AWS?

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services.
It is a cloud computing platform made by Amazon.

That means instead of buying and managing your own computers (servers),
you can rent computing power, storage, and tools from Amazon over the internet.

üï∞Ô∏è Here is a Short History of AWS

2002: Amazon started experimenting with web services.

2006: AWS officially launched with a few basic services:

S3 (for file storage)

EC2 (for virtual computers/servers)

SQS (for message queuing)

2010s: AWS grew fast ‚Äî many startups and big companies started using it.

Today: AWS is one of the largest cloud providers in the world, along with Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet rather than using local servers or personal devices. Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware, you rent computing resources from a provider on an as-needed basis.

THIS ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF CLOUD COMPUTING
- Resources accessed via the internet
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- Scalable (increase or decrease resources as needed)
- No physical hardware maintenance required

    THIS ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF AWS CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES THEY OFFER
  
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) - Virtual servers in the cloud. You can launch different sized virtual machines with various operating systems to run your applications. 
- S3 (Simple Storage Service) - Object storage for files and data. You can store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
- RDS (Relational Database Service) - Managed database service that handles setup, patching, and backups automatically.
- Lambda - Serverless computing where you run code without provisioning servers. 
- CloudFront - Content delivery network (CDN) that distributes your content globally. 
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Lets you create isolated virtual networks within AWS where you control IP addresses, subnets, and security settings.
